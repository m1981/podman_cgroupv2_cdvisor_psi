There are currently 6 namespaces: ● mnt (mount points, filesystems) ● pid (processes) ● net (network stack) ● ipc (System V IPC) ● uts (hostname) ● user (UIDs)
User ID

# What are cgroups
cgroup is a mechanism to organize processes hierarchically and distribute system resources along the hierarchy in a controlled and configurable manner.

cgroup is largely composed of two parts - the core and controllers. cgroup core is primarily responsible for hierarchically organizing processes. A cgroup controller is usually responsible for distributing a specific type of system resource along the hierarchy although there are utility controllers which serve purposes other than resource distribution.

cgroups form a tree structure and every process in the system belongs to one and only one cgroup. All threads of a process belong to the same cgroup. On creation, all processes are put in the cgroup that the parent process belongs to at the time. A process can be migrated to another cgroup. Migration of a process doesn’t affect already existing descendant processes.

Following certain structural constraints, controllers may be enabled or disabled selectively on a cgroup. All controller behaviors are hierarchical - if a controller is enabled on a cgroup, it affects all processes which belong to the cgroups consisting the inclusive sub-hierarchy of the cgroup. When a controller is enabled on a nested cgroup, it always restricts the resource distribution further. The restrictions set closer to the root in the hierarchy can not be overridden from further away.

## Hands on
Rootless containers
Do steps from this page
https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/login/

If /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers is present on your system, you are using v2, otherwise you are using v1.




# Commands

cat /etc/wsl.conf
echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
systemctl --user is-active dbus
